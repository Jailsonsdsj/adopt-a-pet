# üê∂Adopt a petüê±

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and encouraged by [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

In this project, I had the opportunity to practice using React Router to add client-side routing to a React Application. Specifically, I built pet adoption website that allows users to view all the adoptable pets of a particular species and view the profiles of specific adoptable pets.

Make sure you have node.js installed on your computer by rinning the command below:

~~~~node
npm install
~~~~

Finally, you can start the application locally by running the command below:

```
npm start
```



## üìåHow to use

Clone this repository and, in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
